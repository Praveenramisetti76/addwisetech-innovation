# UserAuth: Full-Stack QR Code Authentication & Tracking System

## Overview

UserAuth is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application for user authentication, QR code generation, sharing, claiming, and device/location tracking. The app supports two main user roles: **admin** and **user**. Admins can generate and manage QR codes, while users can claim and track QR codes. The app features secure authentication, role-based route protection, and a modern, responsive UI.

## Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **User Registration & Login**: Secure registration and login for users and admins. Admin registration requires a special code.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure, stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Route protection for admin/user roles.

### QR Code Management
- **QR Code Generation**: Admins can generate one or more QR codes (random 16-digit numbers).
- **QR Code Claiming**: Users can claim unclaimed QR codes by scanning (camera), uploading an image, or manual entry. Claiming requires providing a purpose and location (geolocation).
- **QR Code Tracking**: Users can update and view the location/path of their claimed QR codes. Each tracking event updates the QR codeâ€™s path in the database.
- **QR Code Sharing**: Admins can download QR codes as images and share them with users.

### Device & Location Tracking
- **Geolocation**: Users provide their location when claiming or updating a QR code.
- **Path History**: Each QR code maintains a path history of all locations where it was updated.
- **Map Integration**: Claimed QR codes and their paths are visualized on an interactive map (Leaflet).

### User Experience
- **Modern UI**: Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite for a fast, responsive, and visually appealing experience.
- **Notifications**: Real-time feedback using React Toastify.
- **State Persistence**: Redux Toolkit and Redux Persist for robust state management and session persistence.

## Application Flow

1. **Authentication**
   - Registration: Users can register as either a user or admin. Admin registration requires a special code.
   - Login: Users log in with email and password. On success, a JWT is issued and stored in an HTTP-only cookie.
   - Session Management: Redux and cookies are used to persist login state.
2. **Route Protection**
   - ProtectedRoute: Only allows access to certain routes if the user is authenticated and has the required role.
   - PublicRoute: Redirects logged-in users away from login/signup pages.
3. **Super Admin Features**
   - Super Admin can register using the special code `addwise` during signup.
   - Super Admin can monitor all admins and users from a dedicated dashboard (`/superadmin`).
   - Super Admin has access to view lists of all admins and users, and can be extended to manage them.

## Roles & Signup Codes

- **User:** Default role, no code required.
- **Admin:** Requires code  during signup.
- **Super Admin:** Requires code `addwise` during signup. Has the highest privileges and can monitor all users and admins.

## API Usage: Updating QR Code Location via Postman

To update or append location details to a QR code, use the following endpoints:

| Purpose                        | URL Example                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Assign to user + set location   | http://localhost:3000/api/qr/assign/USER_ID_HERE/7039020220372906           |
| Set location only (no user)     | http://localhost:3000/api/qr/7039020220372906                               |
| Append new location to path     | http://localhost:3000/api/qr/7039020220372906/path                          |

**JSON Body Example:**
```json
{
  "lat": 37.7749,
  "lng": -122.4194
}
```
Replace `lat` and `lng` with the desired coordinates.
